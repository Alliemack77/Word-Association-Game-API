# Word Association Game with Word Quiz API

This project is build with:
- React
- Express
- CSS
- RapidAPI
- Axios

I recreated [Ana Kubow's project](https://github.com/kubowania/word-association-game) to better understand how to consume API's in React. 

Choose the correct answer to win a point. Choose incorrectly and loose a point. 

This project also uses express to build a mini backend which securley stores my API key. 

## To start this project

`npm run start`

Runs the app in development mode
Open (http://localhost:3000/) to view in the browser

`npm run start:backend`

This will start the server on http://localhost:8000.
